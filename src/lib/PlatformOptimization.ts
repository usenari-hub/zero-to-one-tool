        Hi [FRIEND_NAME],
        
        Hope you're doing well! I came across this [ITEM] and immediately thought of you.
        
        I found it through this new platform called University of Bacon - it's basically a marketplace where people earn money by making good connections. If someone purchases something through your referral, you get a percentage as "bacon" (real cash).
        
        The [ITEM]: [DESCRIPTION]
        Price Range: $[PRICE_RANGE]
        
        Even if you're not interested, I thought the platform concept was pretty clever - turning networking into actual income!
        
        Let me know what you think!
        
        Best,
        [YOUR_NAME]
        
        P.S. If you do check it out and end up purchasing, I'll earn a little bacon - but no pressure at all! ðŸ˜Š
